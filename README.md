## 🚀 Offer Dropout Prediction in Recruitment  
This project leverages **predictive modeling** and **data visualization** to address the critical issue of candidate offer dropouts (renege) in talent acquisition. By integrating machine learning algorithms with actionable insights, it provides HR teams with data-driven tools to improve hiring efficiency and reduce costs.  

---

## 🎯 Project Objective  
To develop a **predictive analytics framework** that identifies candidates at risk of declining job offers, enabling proactive interventions to reduce hiring delays and costs.  

---

## 🔑 Key Features  

### 📊 Data Analysis:  
- Designed a **Power BI dashboard** to analyze **demographics**, **recruitment satisfaction**, and **offer dropout trends**.  
- Uncovered key factors like **age**, **distance from office**, and **number of interview rounds** influencing dropouts.  

The data analysis was divided into three key themes to uncover insights and trends:

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Theme 1: Demographic Analysis  
- Explored candidate demographics such as **age**, **gender**, and **distance from office**.  
- Key insight: Candidates aged **30-39** and those living farther than **20 km** had the highest offer drop-out rates.

### 🤖 Data Science:  
- Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, **Decision Tree**, and **Logistic Regression**.  
- Achieved **97.7% accuracy** using **Random Forest**, identifying key predictors such as **Satisfaction Index** and **Days-to-Offer**.

## 📂 Data and Methodology  

### Dataset:  
Recruitment data for **2015-2016**, including candidate demographics, interview details, and offer timelines.  

### Steps:  
1. **Data cleaning** and **feature engineering** (e.g., "Days-to-Offer").  
2. **Model training** and **hyperparameter tuning** (e.g., Grid Search).  

---

## 📈 Results  

1. Identified actionable thresholds, such as **Satisfaction Index ≤ 24.5**, significantly impacting drop-out likelihood.  
2. Provided HR with interpretable models and tools to streamline processes, enhance candidate satisfaction, and offer competitive packages.  

---

## 🌟 Future Scope  

1. **Integration with external data sources** (e.g., market trends via Payscale).  
2. **Extension to other HR functions**, such as employee retention prediction.
